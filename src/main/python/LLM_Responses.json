This totals to \\( (25/2) + 3 = 12.5 + 3 = 15.5 \\) mm.\n   - The distance from the center of the hole to the right edge would be similar, given symmetry.\n\nSo, the distance from the center of the hole to the edge of the part is approximately **15.5 mm**.",

            "To find the distance between the two holes of the part in the provided drawing, we can analyze the dimensions given. \n\nFrom the drawing:\n\n- The two holes are indicated as having a diameter of 6 mm and are located on the top face of the bracket.\n- The center-to-center distance between the two holes can be calculated based on the overall width of the part and the dimensions provided.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n1. The total width of the part is 110 mm.\n2. Each hole is positioned symmetrically, so the distance between the centers of the holes can be derived from the overall width.\n\nGiven that the holes are aligned and centered:\n\n- Each hole is located 25 mm from the sides of the part, meaning the distance between the centers of the two holes is:\n  \n\\[\n\\text{Distance between hole centers} = \\text{Total Width} - 2 \\times \\text{Distance from edge to hole center} = 110 \\, \\text{mm} - 2 \\times 25 \\, \\text{mm} = 60 \\, \\text{mm}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe distance between the centers of the two holes is **60 mm**.",

The holes appear to be evenly spaced.\n\n2. **Calculate the distance from the center**: Since the holes are positioned 12 mm from the center of the circle, the radius of the circle that joins the centers of the holes is 12 mm.\n\n3. **Determine the diameter**: The diameter of the circle is twice the radius. Therefore, the diameter can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Diameter} = 2 \\times \\text{Radius} = 2 \\times 12 \\, \\text{mm} = 24 \\, \\text{mm}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the diameter of the circle joining the centers of the three holes is **24 mm**.",
